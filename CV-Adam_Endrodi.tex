\subsection*{In the Past}

For four years I worked in Helsinki at \hypertarget{gadgets}{Nokia Devices'
R\&D facilities} on the
\href{http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Developer_Guide/Architecture/UI_Framework#hildon-desktop}{compositing window manager} and the
\href{http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Developer_Guide/Using_Multimedia_Components/Media_Application_Framework_(MAFW)}{media application framework}
of the Linux-based Nokia \href{http://maemo.org/intro/maemo_history}{N900}
and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9}{N9} smartphones.

\medskip
After that I joined BalaBit IT Security as $3^{\textrm{\small rd}}$ level
support engineer where I triaged customer problems and actually fixed
tricky bugs in the products of the company.  I also helped the support
team adopt the \href{http://www.kayako.com}{Kayako} ticketing system by
customizing and enhancing it to match and exceed the retired system's
capabilities.

\section{Some Older Projects}

% Initially the program was Linux-only, but later I ported it to Windows.
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{MenuGene}\hfill
\href{http://virt.uni-pannon.hu/index.php/about-the-department}%
{Univ. of Pannonia, Dept. of Information Systems}
\Label{2004--2009}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: Computer-aided nutrition counselling system for experts
and for the laymen.  Based on personal nutrition needs (amount of protein,
fat etc.) the service prepared optimal daily and weekly dietetic menus
computed with \Yell{genetic algorithms}.  This was an
\href{http://github.com/enadam/thesis/raw/master/thesis.pdf}%
{academic research program} involving multiple institutions.\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: As the main software developer I wrote the generator engine
and the underlying libraries in \Yell{C++}.  The service had a simple
\Yell{PHP} web interface and a \Yell{Perl} GUI.  As by-product some
\Yell{debugging tools} in \Yell{C} yielded as well.  I also redesigned
the database schema and migrated it from Oracle to \Yell{PostgreSQL}.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{qbot}\hfill
\href{http://virt.uni-pannon.hu/index.php/about-the-department}%
{Univ. of Pannonia, Dept. of Information Systems}
\Label{2005--2007}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: Automated testing and student performance evaluation
service designed for a course on computer networking.  Students uploaded
their C programs to be compiled and executed in a \texttt{qemu} \Yell{virtual
machine}.  There the submissions were placed under \Yell{stress-test} by
feeding them \Yell{randomized}, \Yell{fuzzy} input sequences.  The behavior
of the programs was validated against the specification set out in the
assignment.  Through the web interface teachers could supervise everyone's
activity, students could manage their uploads and watch the test execution
in real-time.
\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: I designed and implemented the system from top to the bottom
in \Yell{Perl} augmented with \Yell{Perl XS}, and prepared many assignments
complete with validators.

%\midline\par
%\Label{Project name}: \hypertarget{mcompositor}{\href{http://github.com/nemomobile-graveyard/mcompositor}{\texttt{mcompositor}}}\hfill
%\hyperlink{MeeGo}{MeeGo Devices} \Label{2010 Sept--2011 Sept}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: Development of the composition and window manager of
%\hyperlink{gadgets}{N9} (Harmattan program).  This software is responsible
%for the user-interaction of the top-level UI elements, and also coordinates
%between the different applications and background services.  Its performance
%and reliability were critical in the device's user experience.  It was written
%in \Yell{C++} with the \Yell{Qt} toolkit and \Yell{OpenGL} backend, and the
%development was managed via \Yell{scrum}.  Its \Yell{automated functional
%tests} were written in \Yell{Python}.\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: feature enhancements, user-interaction improvements,
%debugging internal problems, debugging software interaction problems,
%optimization, refactoring.  For a while I was responsible for releasing
%the software for system integration, ensuring that outstanding issues
%are fixed in the release.  I also worked with the \Yell{Toolkit} and
%\Yell{Graphical adaptation} teams when necessity arose.
%
%\midline\par
%\Label{Project name}:
%\href{http://github.com/Cordia/hildon-desktop}{\texttt{hildon-desktop}}\hfill
%\hyperlink{Maemo}{Maemo Software} \Label{2008 Sept--2010 Aug}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: This was the predecessor of \hyperlink{mcompositor}%
%{\texttt{mcompositor}}, developed for the \hyperlink{gadgets}{N900}
%(Fremantle program).  It used different technologies (written in \Yell{C}
%and \Yell{Clutter}, the high-level \Yell{OpenGL} library), and had more
%sub-components, many of which I was involved with (eg.
%\href{http://www.libsdl.org}{SDL}).\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: I wrote the \Yell{task switcher}, implemented the
%\Yell{portrait mode}, worked on the desktop notifications and on
%the visual transition effects of various GUI elements.  I maintained
%a healthy and bidirectional contact with our UI designers.  During
%both this and the \hyperlink{mcompositor}{\texttt{mcompositor}}
%projects I wrote many \Yell{automated tests} for specific, hard
%to reproduce bugs, which helped their resolution.  I also created
%many other \Yell{development tools}, which were useful in bug hunting.
%They are \href{http://github.com/enadam?tab=repositories}{public} now,
%and even today I make use some of them.
%
%\midline\par
%\Label{Project name}: \href{http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Developer_Guide/Using_Multimedia_Components/Media_Application_Framework_(MAFW)}{Media Application Framework (MAFW)}\hfill
%\hyperlink{Maemo}{Maemo Software} \Label{2007 Aug--2008 Aug}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: Middleware for multimedia applications on the
%\hyperlink{gadgets}{N900}.  It provided an abstraction layer between
%the application and the various content and metadata sources (eg. local
%file system) and playback devices (eg. \Yell{UPnP} or \Yell{gstreamer}).
%It was written in \Yell{C} and was based on \Yell{GObject}.  It was
%designed to be extensible by \Yell{plugins} and for testability it had
%\Yell{Python bindings}.  This was the first team within Maemo Software
%to explore \Yell{scrum} as project management methodology.\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: \Yell{reviewed} the predecessor Multimedia Application's
%as well as MAFW's pilot implementation and \Yell{compiled a report} of
%questions and suggestions, conducted the \Yell{security threat analysis}
%of MAFW, worked on the \Yell{Python modules}, on the \Yell{D-BUS message
%passing} layer, and on the \Yell{SQLite} access functions.  Also I introduced
%\Yell{continuous integration} into the project with a heavily tailored
%\Yell{buildbot} installation.
%
%\midline\par
%\Label{Project name}: system administration at the Central Student's Hostel
%of the Univ. of Pannonia\hfill
%\Label{2003--2005}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: The Hostel's computer network was comprised of several
%servers, hundreds of client machines and dozens of interconnecting devices.
%It offered \Yell{shell}, \Yell{www}, \Yell{ftp}, \Yell{mail} access and spam
%filtering services to the students, and functioned as a \Yell{gateway} to
%the University network and to the Internet.  All services acquired the user
%information from a central \Yell{LDAP} directory.  Special emphasis was put on
%\Yell{security}, \Yell{availability} and \Yell{reliability}.\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: Together with my colleague we thoroughly redesigned the entire
%outdated infrastructure we had inherited to meet our quality criteria, and
%after that we monitored and maintained it 7/24.  My most remarkable individual
%project was the completely reworked and \Yell{integrated registration and
%gate-keeper system}, which we used at the receptions and as an administrator's
%console.
%
%%\href{http://www.mit.bme.hu/eng}%
%%{Dept. of Measurement and Information Systems},
%%Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME), Hungary
%\midline\par
%\Label{Project name}: Information security in the face of Internet attacks\hfill
%\Label{2002--2003}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: Government-supported project of the Budapest University
%of Technology and Economics (BME) to assess the then-widespread threats of
%the Internet, based on collected sensor data (eg. firewall logs) and
%to analyze their potential impact.\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: I wrote the programs which \Yell{created surveys} of
%the collected data and provided \Yell{consultancy on technical matters}
%helping revealing significant findings in the study.
