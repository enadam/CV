%\item	jenkins
\end{compressedItemize}

Lately I've become involved with future development directions of the
product, assisting the architects to make informed design decisions.

\medskip
All my work revolves around Linux and increasingly around virtual computing
(``cloudification'' of existing offerings), but I'm also familiar with the
``legacy'' (DX200) platform and hardware.

\subsection*{Previously}

For four years I worked on-site at \hypertarget{gadgets}{Nokia Devices'
R\&D facilities} on the middleware of the resource-constrained environment
of the Linux-based Nokia \href{http://maemo.org/intro/maemo_history}{N900}
and \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_N9}{N9} smartphones.

\medskip
After that I joined BalaBit IT Security as $3^{\textrm{\small rd}}$ level
support engineer, where I responded to customer problems with the products
of the company (application level proxies and system operators auditing
software) and fixing tricky bugs in them.  I also helped the support team
migrating to the \href{http://www.kayako.com}{Kayako} ticketing system
by customizing and enhancing it to match and exceed the retired system's
capabilities.

\section{Past Projects (selection)}

\Label{Project name}: \hypertarget{mcompositor}{\href{http://meego.gitorious.org/meegotouch/meegotouch-compositor}{\texttt{mcompositor}}}\hfill
\hyperlink{MeeGo}{MeeGo Devices} \Label{2010 Sept--2011 Sept}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: Development of the composition and window manager of
\hyperlink{gadgets}{N9} (Harmattan program).  This software is responsible
for the user-interaction of the top-level UI elements, and also coordinates
between the different applications and background services.  Its performance
and reliability were critical in the device's user experience.  It was written
in \Yell{C++} with the \Yell{Qt} toolkit and \Yell{OpenGL} backend, and the
development was managed via \Yell{scrum}.  Its \Yell{automated functional
tests} were written in \Yell{Python}.\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: feature enhancements, user-interaction improvements,
debugging internal problems, debugging software interaction problems,
optimization, refactoring.  For a while I was responsible for releasing
the software for system integration, ensuring that outstanding issues
are fixed in the release.  I also worked with the \Yell{Toolkit} and
\Yell{Graphical adaptation} teams when necessity arose.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \href{http://maemo.gitorious.org/fremantle-hildon-desktop/hildon-desktop}{\texttt{hildon-desktop}}\hfill
\hyperlink{Maemo}{Maemo Software} \Label{2008 Sept--2010 Aug}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: This was the predecessor of \hyperlink{mcompositor}%
{\texttt{mcompositor}}, developed for the \hyperlink{gadgets}{N900}
(Fremantle program).  It used different technologies (written in \Yell{C}
and \Yell{Clutter}, the high-level \Yell{OpenGL} library), and had more
sub-components, many of which I was involved with (eg.
\href{http://www.libsdl.org}{SDL}).\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: I wrote the \Yell{task switcher}, implemented the
\Yell{portrait mode}, worked on the desktop notifications and on
the visual transition effects of various GUI elements.  I maintained
a healthy and bidirectional contact with our UI designers.  During
both this and the \hyperlink{mcompositor}{\texttt{mcompositor}}
projects I wrote many \Yell{automated tests} for specific, hard
to reproduce bugs, which helped their resolution.  I also created
many other \Yell{development tools}, which were useful in bug hunting.
They are \href{http://github.com/enadam?tab=repositories}{public} now,
and even today I make use some of them.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \href{http://wiki.maemo.org/Documentation/Maemo_5_Developer_Guide/Using_Multimedia_Components/Media_Application_Framework_(MAFW)}{Media Application Framework (MAFW)}\hfill
\hyperlink{Maemo}{Maemo Software} \Label{2007 Aug--2008 Aug}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: Middleware for multimedia applications on the
\hyperlink{gadgets}{N900}.  It provided an abstraction layer between
the application and the various content and metadata sources (eg. local
file system) and playback devices (eg. \Yell{UPnP} or \Yell{gstreamer}).
It was written in \Yell{C} and was based on \Yell{GObject}.  It was
designed to be extensible by \Yell{plugins} and for testability it had
\Yell{Python bindings}.  This was the first team within Maemo Software
to explore \Yell{scrum} as project management methodology.\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: \Yell{reviewed} the predecessor Multimedia Application's
as well as MAFW's pilot implementation and \Yell{compiled a report} of
questions and suggestions, conducted the \Yell{security threat analysis}
of MAFW, worked on the \Yell{Python modules}, on the \Yell{D-BUS message
passing} layer, and on the \Yell{SQLite} access functions.  Also I introduced
\Yell{continuous integration} into the project with a heavily tailored
\Yell{buildbot} installation.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{MenuGene}\hfill
\href{http://virt.uni-pannon.hu/index.php/about-the-department}%
{Univ. of Pannonia, Dept. of Information Systems}
\Label{2004--2009}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: Computer aided nutrition counseling system for experts
and for the laymen.  The user entered his/her nutrition needs (the amount
of protein, fat etc.), and the service computed an optimal daily or weekly 
dietetic menu with a \Yell{genetic algorithm}.  This was a university
research project, extending to other academic institutions.\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: As the main software developer I wrote the service program
and the underlying libraries in \Yell{C++}.  The service had a simple
\Yell{PHP} web interface and a \Yell{Perl} GUI.  Some \Yell{development
tools} in \Yell{C} yielded as well.  Initially the program was Linux-only,
but later I \Yell{ported} it to Windows.  I also redesigned the data store's
\Yell{SQL} schema and migrated it from Oracle to \Yell{PostgreSQL}.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{qbot}\hfill
\href{http://virt.uni-pannon.hu/index.php/about-the-department}%
{Univ. of Pannonia, Dept. of Information Systems}
\Label{2005--2007}\par\medskip
\Label{Description}: Automated testing and student performance evaluation
service designed for a course on computer networking.  The students uploaded
their C programs which the service compiled and executed in a \texttt{qemu}
\Yell{virtual machine}.  Then they were placed under \Yell{stress-test} by
feeding them \Yell{randomized}, \Yell{fuzzy} input sequences.  The responses
were validated against the specification set out in the assignment.
The service also featured a web interface through which teachers could
supervise everyone's activity, students could manage their uploads and
watch the test execution in real-time.\par\medskip
\Label{Duties}: I designed and implemented the system from the ground-up
mostly in \Yell{Perl} and \Yell{Perl XS}, and prepared many assignments,
each requiring a matching validator program.

%\midline\par
%\Label{Project name}: system administration at the Central Student's Hostel
%of the Univ. of Pannonia\hfill
%\Label{2003--2005}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: The Hostel's computer network was comprised of several
%servers, hundreds of client machines and dozens of interconnecting devices.
%It offered \Yell{shell}, \Yell{www}, \Yell{ftp}, \Yell{mail} access and spam
%filtering services to the students, and functioned as a \Yell{gateway} to
%the University network and to the Internet.  All services acquired the user
%information from a central \Yell{LDAP} directory.  Special emphasis was put on
%\Yell{security}, \Yell{availability} and \Yell{reliability}.\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: Together with my colleague we thoroughly redesigned the entire
%outdated infrastructure we had inherited to meet our quality criteria, and
%after that we monitored and maintained it 7/24.  My most remarkable individual
%project was the completely reworked and \Yell{integrated registration and
%gate-keeper system}, which we used at the receptions and as an administrator's
%console.

%\Label{Project name}: Information security in the face of Internet attacks\hfill
%\Label{2002--2003}\par\medskip
%\Label{Description}: Government-supported project of the Budapest University
%of Technology and Economics (BME) to assess the then-widespread threats of
%the Internet, based on collected sensor data (eg. firewall logs) and
%to analyze their potential impact.\par\medskip
%\Label{Duties}: I wrote the programs which \Yell{created surveys} of
%the collected data and provided \Yell{consultancy on technical matters}
%helping revealing significant findings in the study.
