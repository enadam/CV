\item	life cycle- and process-wide understanding of software engineering
\item	11 years of Perl, 9 of C++, 10+ of C, Unix and specifically Linux
\item	experience in a variety of domains of information technology
\item	high level scripting and automation
\item	testing, tracing, profiling, debugging
\item	emphasis on quality, reliability and maintainability
\end{itemize}

\section{Past projects}

For four years I worked onsite at Nokia Corp.'s R\&D facilities in Helsinki,
Finland, on the middleware of the resource-constrained environment of the
\Yell{Linux}-based Nokia N900 and N9 smartphones.  After that I joined
BalaBit IT Security as level-3 support engineer, where I responded to
customer problems about the products of the company (application level
proxies and auditing software) and fixing bugs in them.  Currently I'm
employed at Nokia Siemens Networks as senior software engineer.  My
current project is building a \href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6733}%
{DIAMETER} (successor of the \href{http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2865}%
{RADIUS} protocol) load balancer on Linux for the Nokia NVS.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{mcompositor}\hfill
\Label{2010 Sept -- 2011 Sept}\par
\Label{Description}: Development of the composition and window manager of N9
(Harmattan program).  This software is responsible for the user-interaction
of the top-level UI elements, and also coordinates between the different
applications and background services.  Its performance and reliability is
critical in the device's user experience.  It is written in \Yell{C++} with
the \Yell{Qt} toolkit and \Yell{OpenGL} backend, and the development was
managed via \Yell{scrum}.  It has \Yell{automated functional tests} written in
\Yell{Python}.\par
\Label{Duties}: feature enhancements, user-interaction improvements,
debugging internal problems, debugging software interaction problems,
optimization, refactoring.  For a while I was responsible for releasing
the software for system integration, ensuring that outstanding issues
are fixed in the release.  I also worked with the \Yell{Toolkit} and
\Yell{Graphical adaptation} teams when necessity arose.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{hildon-desktop}\hfill
\Label{2008 Sept -- 2010 Aug}\par
\Label{Description}: This was the predecessor of \texttt{mcompositor},
developed for the N900 (Fremantle program).  It used different technologies
(written in \Yell{C} and \Yell{Clutter}, the high-level \Yell{OpenGL}
library), and had more sub-components, many of which I was involved with
too (eg. SDL).\par
\Label{Duties}: I wrote the \Yell{task switcher}, implemented the
\Yell{portrait mode}, worked on the desktop notifications and on
the visual transitions of GUI elements.  I maintained a friendly and
bidirectional contact with our UI designers.  During both this and
the \texttt{mcompositor} projects I wrote many \Yell{automated tests}
for specific, hard to reproduce bugs which helped their resolution.
I also created many other \Yell{development tools}, which were useful
in generic bug reproduction, bugfixing and in profiling.

\newpage
\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: Media Applications Framework (MAFW)\hfill
\Label{2007 Aug -- 2008 Aug}\par
\Label{Description}: Middleware for multimedia applications on the N900.
It provided an abstraction layer between the application and the various
content and metadata sources (eg. local file system) and playback devices
(eg. \Yell{UPnP} or \Yell{gstreamer}).  It was written in \Yell{C} and was
based on \Yell{GObject}.  For extensibility it used plugins, and for
testability it had \Yell{Python bindings}.\par
\Label{Duties}: \Yell{reviewed} the predecessor Multimedia Application's
as well as MAFW's pilot implementation and \Yell{compiled a report} of
questions and suggestions, conducted the \Yell{security threat analysis}
of MAFW, worked on the \Yell{Python modules}, on the \Yell{D-BUS message
passing} layer, and on the \Yell{SQLite} access functions.  Also I introduced
\Yell{continuous integration} into the project with a heavily tailored
\Yell{buildbot} installation.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{MenuGene}\hfill
\Label{2004 -- 2009}\par
\Label{Description}: Computer aided nutrition counseling system for
experts and for the laymen.  This was a research project at the University
of Pannonia, and extended to other academic institutions.\par
\Label{Duties}: As the main software developer, I wrote the foundation
libraries including the \Yell{genetic algorithm solver} engine, and the
service programs in \Yell{C++}.  In addition I created user interfaces
and \Yell{development tools} in \Yell{C}, \Yell{Perl} and \Yell{PHP}.
Initially the program was developed for \Yell{Linux}, and later I ported
the service to \Yell{Windows}.  I also redesigned the data store's \Yell{SQL}
schema and migrated it from Oracle to \Yell{PostgreSQL}.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: \texttt{qbot}\hfill
\Label{2005 -- 2007}\par
\Label{Description}: Automated testing and student evaluation service for a
course on computer networking at the University of Pannonia.  The students
uploaded their C programs, which the service executed in a \texttt{qemu}
\Yell{virtual machine}, and were \Yell{stress-tested} with \Yell{randomized},
\Yell{fuzzy} input, to which the test program had to behave as specified in
the assignment.  The service had a web interface through which teachers could
supervise everyone's activity, students could manage their uploads and observe
the interaction between theirs and the test program.\par
\Label{Duties}: I designed and implemented the system from the ground up mostly
in \Yell{Perl} and \Yell{Perl XS}, and wrote many assignments (each of which
requiring a different tester program).

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: system administration at the Central Student's Hostel
of the Univ. of Pannonia\hfill
\Label{2003 -- 2005}\par
\Label{Description}: The Hostel's computer network was comprised of several
servers, hundreds of client machines and dozens of interconnecting devices.
It offered \Yell{shell}, \Yell{www}, \Yell{ftp}, \Yell{mail} access and spam
filtering services to the students, and functioned as a \Yell{gateway} to
the University network and to the Internet.  All services acquired the user
information from a central \Yell{LDAP} directory.  Special emphasis was put on
\Yell{security}, \Yell{availability} and \Yell{reliability}.\par
\Label{Duties}: Together with my colleague we thoroughly redesigned the entire
outdated infrastructure we had inherited to meet our quality criteria, and
after that we monitored and maintained it 7/24.  My most remarkable individual
project was the completely reworked and \Yell{integrated registration and
gate-keeper system}, which we used at the receptions and as an administrator's
console.

\midline\par
\Label{Project name}: Information security in the face of Internet attacks\hfill
\Label{2002 -- 2003}\par
\Label{Description}: Government-supported project of the Budapest University
of Technology and Economics (BME) to assess the then-widespread threats of
the Internet based on collected sensor data (eg. firewall logs) and
to analyse their potential impact.\par
\Label{Duties}: I wrote the programs which \Yell{created surveys} of
the collected data and provided \Yell{consultancy on technical matters}
helping revealing significant findings in the study.
